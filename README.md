"Time to Change Our World" is a song that uses upbeat rhythms and melodies to promote Indigenous peoples' rights and
emphasize their battles for acknowledgment and justice. It is meant to bring awareness to the indigenous peoples,
and their struggles to have their basic needs, like drinking water, addressed. This cause is very important to me 
because it represents my conviction in the need to recognize and tackle the continuous difficulties faced by 
underprivileged populations. As someone who has recently begun to code, making this piece has me a great chance to 
hone my abilities while also contributing to a meaningful message that inspires others to realize the need for change
and take action toward a more just and fair society.

Call to Action: We have been quiet for too long, it is time to advocate for Indigenous 
rights by raising awareness, supporting Indigenous-led initiatives, and promoting education
and policy changes that honour their history and foster a just future.
